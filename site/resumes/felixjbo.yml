    summary: |
      I have a strong science and mathematical mindset, as my first career is Materials Science and Engineering. Soon I recognized that I am better at computers so here I am.

      Now I am a student of Systems Engineering and also taking this Data Science bootcamp, that is where I want to put my focus now and in the near future.

      My current work is very related to this as a Data Analyst in Google's customer service. Also, I have been involved in several volunteering projects thoughout my life.
